# 📡 RFID Pay Box

## 🏷️ Imitating Coin Acceptor Functionality with Wireless Technology

### 📖 Introduction

The **RFID Pay Box** is designed to **imitate the functionality of a coin acceptor** while integrating **RFID-based payment**. Instead of inserting a coin, a user taps an RFID tag on the device. The system then checks the **cloud database** for validation and generates a pulse, just like a traditional coin acceptor, enabling seamless transition from **physical coin payments to digital RFID payments**.
